        development, specializing in custom application architectures that are
        semantic, fast and stable. Tihs end-to-end versatility helps me
        anticipate problems before they occur and build seamless, custom
        applications that are focused, effecient and bullet proof. Writing
        debt-free code that optimizes the flow of each application and minimizes
        rework is my professional passion. I follow AGILE product development
        processes and enjoy working in a sosial, collaborative environment.
